# Payment_fraud_detection-using-MachineLearning

# What is fraud detection?
* Fraud is the crime of getting money by deceiving people, where these kinds of fraud has been around for years and years now in many different ways, but one of the most is Money Fraud in digital world.
* Fraud has become an major issue with regular changes and transformation like scamming, online banking, fake websites, unsecured websites, insurance etc. even through offline.
* Detecting, preventing, and fighting fraud are among the primary concerns in the modern-day world. One of the most effective ways of managing attacks and risks is by using machine learning algorithms for fraud detection.

# Project objective
* Machine Learning algorithms nowadays has been an action oriented solutions to solve problems using the available relevant data in a faster way possible with accuracy.
* The informations collected across all the platforms especially in Transactions of payments helps in better for alogrithms to spot the behaviours, patterns and learn about the data and provide a best results as possible.

# Datasets 
## About Dataset
* To identify online payment fraud with machine learning, we need to train a machine learning model for classifying fraudulent and non-fraudulent payments. For this, we need a dataset containing information about online payment fraud, so that we can understand what type of transactions lead to fraud. For this task, I collected a dataset from Kaggle, which contains historical information about fraudulent transactions which can be used to detect fraud in online payments. Below are all the columns from the dataset I’m using here:

- step: represents a unit of time where 1 step equals 1 hour
- type: type of online transaction
amount: the amount of the transaction
nameOrig: customer starting the transaction
oldbalanceOrg: balance before the transaction
newbalanceOrig: balance after the transaction
nameDest: recipient of the transaction
oldbalanceDest: initial balance of recipient before the transaction
newbalanceDest: the new balance of recipient after the transaction
isFraud: fraud transaction

I hope you now know about the data I am using for the online payment fraud detection task. Now in the section below, I’ll explain how we can use machine learning to detect online payment fraud using Python.
